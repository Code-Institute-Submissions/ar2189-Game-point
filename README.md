# Lasepoint
Laserpoint is a lasertag spot where you go to have fun with friends, families and even collegues. The area is like any other lasertag game area,
where one player starts from one point in a labyrinth and proceeds to find the other players to shoot them with the laser gun. The last one standing
is the winner. These are the basic rules for this games but people can also play via co-op or teams.
Laserpoint also has an area for people who like to play games on PC like the ones in internet cafes. The PCs have a variety of games at their disposal like
COD, Battlefront, League of legends and more. If people are fans of old school games, they also have the oppurtunity to visit the arcade area where vintage 
games like Pacman, Contra, Tekken 1 and more can be played.
